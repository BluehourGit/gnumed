Hello all,

I am glad to be able to announce the immediate availability
of the GNUmed x.x.x Maintenance Release. It features the
following bug fixes and minor improvements:

Changelog:

	xx replace with CHANGELOG xx


Downloads available from:

Client installation:

 Easily installable packages for your platform of choice
 will be available shortly.

 Meanwhile you can run the client from a downloaded tarball
 or use the net based client installer:

	http://www.gnumed.de/downloads/client/gm-install_client_locally.sh

 which you need to download, make executable, and run.

Database installation / upgrade:

 Note that this release, as usual, does NOT require a
 database upgrade. However, fixes to the database may
 have been provided which you can (and should) install
 with either

 or

	$> cd .../server/bootstrap/
	$> ./fixup-db.sh XX
