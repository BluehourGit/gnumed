==========================

Mo 22 Aug 2005 15:04:32 CEST

  - properly constrain "day of month" calculation in date input widget

client 0.1rc4 -> rc5
====================

So 07 Aug 2005 21:05:22 CEST

  health issue edit area _patient bug:

  The cEditArea2 class *used* self._patient but did not
  *instantiate* it ... It also needs to properly deregister
  its signals on close.

So 14 Aug 2005 17:01:39 CEST

  enable startup without config file:

  Now properly falls back to the public server as a default
  and also properly scans the plugin directory for plugins
  to load into the notebook.

So 14 Aug 2005 17:31:08 CEST

  new patient wizard country phrasewheel bug:

  Faulty match provider SQL in country phrasewheel in
  new patient wizard fixed.

Mo 15 Aug 2005 18:08:09 CEST

  package generation script polishing:

  - include example config file in docs
  - exclude plugins not loaded in 0.1

Fr 19 Aug 2005 08:59:37 CEST

  i18n on Windows:

  Gettext looks for $LANG on Windows, too, but Windows
  does not provide that variable. So allow to set it if
  necessary. So, Windows features language support now, too.

=================================================================
So 07 Aug 2005 18:35:12 CEST

client 0.1rc3 -> rc4
====================

locale LC_ALL bug
-----------------

On Suse 9.3 python locale.setlocale(LC_ALL) returns the
entire locale set (as it should). We wrongly assumed it only
returns LC_MESSAGES and hence were unable to properly sync
with the database locale settings. Fixed.

episode display refresh
-----------------------

When adding an episode in one client while displaying the
EMR tree in another one an error occurred in the latter when
trying to refresh the health issue/episode tree from the
backend due to concurrent variable access in the
middleware. Dramatically shortened the window for this to be
possible to occur.
