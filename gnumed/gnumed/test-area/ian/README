This is a putative forms/letters system for gnumed. based on LaTeX

The file a4form.cls is a LaTeX class file. Put it in the TeX search
path (on Debian /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/a4form/) then run
"texhash" as root to make sure TeX can find it. 

The module accepts a LaTeX file and a dictionary.
The dictionary is translated to set of TeX macros,
which can be used in the document. The document can be any LaTeX 
document, however a special class (a4form) is defined to print
text at specific positions.

Advantages:
	- one-stop-shop: scripts, forms, letters can all be expressed as templates.
	- high quality output
	- totally free (including the fonts)
	- can run without a GUI, such as on a server
	- cross-platform, including Windows

Disadvantages
	- old-fashioned (TeX dates back to mid-1980s)
	- big dependency (about the same size as wxWindows DLL)
