LOINC Copyright and Terms of Use
LOINC Copyright and Terms of Use The LOINC® codes, LOINC® Users' Guide, and LOINC® database are copyright © 1995-2004, 
Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) Committee. All rights reserved. 
LOINC® is a registered trademark of Regenstrief Institute, Inc. Permission is hereby granted in perpetuity, without payment 
of license fees or royalties, to use, copy, or distribute the LOINC® codes, LOINC® Users' Guide, and the LOINC® database for
 any commercial or non-commercial purpose, subject to the following terms and conditions: 

 1) To prevent the dilution of the purpose of the LOINC codes and LOINC database of providing a definitive standard for identifying 
clinical information in electronic reports, users shall not use the LOINC Users' Guide, the LOINC codes, and/or the LOINC database 
for the purpose of developing or promulgating a different standard for identifying laboratory test results, diagnostic study reports, 
or clinical measurements and observations in electronic reports and messages. 

 2) Users shall not change the meaning of any of the LOINC codes. Users shall not change the name of, or any contents of, any fields 
in the LOINC database. Users may add new fields to the LOINC database to attach
additional information to existing LOINC records. 

 3) A user may delete records from the LOINC database to deal with the user's local requirements. A user also may add new records to the
LOINC database to deal with the users' local requirements, provided that if new records are added, any new entry in the LOINC_NUM field
(field #1) of such new records must contain a leading alphabetic "X" so that the new codes and records cannot be confused with existing 
LOINC codes or new LOINC codes as they are defined in later releases of the LOINC database. Records deleted or added by users to deal with 
local requirements are not reflected in the official LOINC database maintained by the Regenstrief Institute and the LOINC Committee. 

 4) LOINC codes and other information from the LOINC database may be used in electronic messages for laboratory test results and clinical 
observations such as HL7 ORU messages, without the need to include this LOINC Copyright Notice and License or a reference thereto in the 
message (and without the need to include all fields required by Section 6 hereof). When the LOINC code (from the LOINC_NUM field) is 
included in the message, users are encouraged, but not required, to include the corresponding LOINC short name (from the SHORTNAME 
field) in the message if the message provides a place for a text name representation of the code.

 5) Users may make and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the unmodified LOINC database. Each copy of the unmodified LOINC 
database must include this LOINC Copyright Notice and License, and must include the version number of the database. This LOINC Copyright 
Notice and License must appear on every printed copy of the LOINC database. Where the LOINC database is distributed on a fixed storage 
medium (such as diskette or CD-ROM), a printed copy of this LOINC Copyright Notice and License must be included on or with the storage 
medium, and a text file containing this information also must be stored on the storage medium in a file called "LOINC_license.txt". 
Where the LOINC database is distributed via the Internet, this LOINC Copyright Notice and License must be accessible on the same 
Internet page from which the LOINC database is available for download.

 6) Subject to Section 1 and the other restrictions hereof, users may incorporate portions of the LOINC database into another laboratory 
test definition database or software program for distribution outside of the user's corporation or organization, provided that any such 
laboratory test definition database or software program includes the following fields reproduced in their entirety from the LOINC 
database:
            LOINC_NUM (field #1), 
            COMPONENT (field #2), 
            PROPERTY (field #3),
            TIME_ASPCT (field #4), 
            SYSTEM (field #5), 
            SCALE_TYP (field #6), 
            METHOD_TYP (field #7), 
            ANSWERLIST (field #18), 
            STATUS (field #19), and 
            SHORTNAME (field #59). 

Users are encouraged, but not required, to also include the RELAT_NMS (field #8) in any such database. Further description of these 
fields is provided in Appendix A of the LOINC Users' Guide. Every copy of the LOINC database incorporated into or distributed in
conjunction with another database or software program must include the following notice: "This product includes all or a portion
of the LOINC® database, or is derived from the LOINC® database, subject to a license from Regenstrief Institute, Inc. Your use of

 7) Use and distribution of the LOINC codes and LOINC database in ways that are not specifically discussed
herein shall always be accompanied by the notice provided in Section 6 hereof. The guidelines for providing the notice that are contained
