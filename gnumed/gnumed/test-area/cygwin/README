The following scripts do the following:

cygwin.ed , cygwin_path.sh cygwin_restore.sh, cygwin_remove.sh

This group of files gets around the symlink problem with cygwin.
(python in cygwin doesn't follow the Gnumed symlink).

cygwin_path.sh changes all the import from Gnumed.. lines in
the .py files to import from client..  ; the old files 
are put as .pybak files.

cygwin_restore.sh undoes those changes.

cygwin_remove.sh removes the .pybak files.

----------------------------------------------------

bootstrap_parse.py

This generates the order of installation for the sql files
from the bootstrap-monolithic_core.conf  file in server/bootstrap

install-schema.sh 
This uses bootstrap_parse.py  to create the gnumed database.
Both should be put in the sql directory , 
then 
	sh install-schema.sh 

redo-max.sh doesn't run in cygwin for some reason ;
this is a temporary workaround to get things running on cygwin.
