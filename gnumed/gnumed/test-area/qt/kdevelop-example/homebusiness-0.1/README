This is an example of using STL, C++, and QT for a database application using
the technique taught in a basic java course : make an application ,
provide a console user interface to test and drive the application,
and then  re-use the tested application in a graphical user interface

1. console to graphical application:
  - the application was developed as a text console app,
  and was later adapted for a particular UI library (qt).

2. layering:
  the "layers" are a domain layer in Customer.h,
  a persistence layer in Containers.h which uses the pq postgres driver library,
  and a application layer , initially in application1.h for the console version,
  and later as QT dialogs and ordermainadapter.h
    ordermainadapter.h converts between the standard C++ types/STL,
    and QT types.

3. the initial console application was  plain c functions but was later changed
into a C++ class.


The domain layer consists of classes Customer, Order, Product, ProductOffer,
OrderItem, and later Discountable and Discount were added, where Order and
OrderItem inherited from Discountable so they could have discounts applied
either at the individual order item level or the order level.
Discount is either a PercentDiscount or an AmountDiscount.

There is also a Money class with an AUMoney subclass with dollars and cents.
Perhaps other Money classes can be created.
