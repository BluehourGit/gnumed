This program should:

1. read a configuration file 

2. parse the configuration file into a symbol table/Dictionary

3. read the dictionary.

4. generate a persistable data structure from the dictionary definitions under data.

5. generate a gui editor for the data structure 

6. generate the links for actions in the editor to transfer data to and from editor from 
  the datastore.

1. use an xml document reader.
	rationale:
		- modelled after the ant system.
		- trendy to use xml files.
		- xml fits in with tree based EHR 

	potential problems
		- a highly fine grained datastore , i.e. nodal with nodal types, 
		may cause problems when data volumes get high ( > 10,000 ?)
		, especially implemented on a relational system, designed to preserve
		conceptual layout at a readable level.
