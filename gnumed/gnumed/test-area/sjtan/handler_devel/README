This is a demo of using a local model for the user interface written by Richard Terry and Ian Heywood.
The local model can have a proxy to provide functions such as locking with periodic
local saving;  local model to database model translation and update.

This model puts some functionality in the past history, allergies and scripts panels.

The handler classes were written to expose the ui classes with minimal alteration to
those classes and without subclassing. 

In terms of model view controller ,  gmEditArea, the gmGP classes in gui and patient, 
are the views,  handler_editarea_impl, handler_gmPersonSelect_impl are controller
implementations, and models are in patient_model. 

Domain specific features:

icd9 search engine, for past_history and the prescription reason field in script.

class drug consistency, in allergies and scripts.


should be able to run if already installed a postgresql  database called gnumed,
and can get past the login stuff.

** running gmGuiMain.py will give debugging output back to the console.
