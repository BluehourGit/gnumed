The following steps were tested:


Have a java sdk1.4.2  installed.   

Have ant installed. 


1.
get tomcat from 
http://apache.planetmirror.com.au/dist/jakarta/tomcat-5/v5.0.28/bin/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28.tar.gz

tar -zxvf xxx.tar.gz  to unpack.

2.
get struts from
http://apache.planetmirror.com.au/dist/jakarta/struts/binaries/jakarta-struts-1.1.tar.gz



3.
In order to compile, certain library files ( all file contents of {struts-basedir}/lib directory , and {tomcat-basedir}/commons/lib/servlet-api.jar )
must be COPIED into  WEB-INF/lib/ of this directory
	Reason: these files need to be found by the build.xml   


4.
In order to run, {tomcat-basedir}/commons/lib/  must have a valid postgres jar file  (e.g. common/lib/pg73jdbc2.jar ).
 On the Mandrake system I am using, these jar files are found in /usr/share/pgsql  and there are 3 there, but you only
need one (xxxjdb2.jar seems to work).

	Reason: the tomcat server manages pooled database connections using commons-pool , and requires the database driver for
postgres which is it must be able to find.  {tomcat-basdir}/shared/lib  and this application WEB-INF/lib directory don't work
as places to put the postgres jar file.


5.In order to run tomcat,   {tomcat-basedir}/conf/tomcat-users.xml   should have the lines 
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat,manager"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin"/>


before running tomcat. This creates the roles of admin and manager. The manager role is the most important.



6. Set the right context path in the  META-INF/context.xml  configuration file.

In the 3rd line,

<Context crossContext="true" debug="5" docBase="/home/sjtan/projects/test-struts-3" path="/test-struts-3" reloadable="true" scope="session">

change /home/sjtan/projects/test-struts-3  to where this directory resides, 
e.g. /home/john/projects/gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3

hint: test that it is the path by selecting the docBase string, and then on the command line, do a 'ls' and paste the string.




7. compile by changing to /WEB-INF/src where the build.xml file is , and typing 'ant'.


8. start tomcat, by going to {tomcat-basedir}/bin/   and typing 'catalina.sh debug' , followed by 'run' at the '>' prompt.


9. go to http://localhost:8080  to see if tomcat ran.

10. go to http://localhost:8080/manager ; if step 5. works, then the user name 'tomcat', password 'tomcat' should give
the manager page.

11. Point tomcat to the context.xml file of step 6.
In the box on the manager page which says: -

Deploy directory or WAR file located on server
    XML Configuration file URL: [                       ]

put the file:/home/john/projects/gnumed/gnumed/test-area/sjtan/test-struts-3/META-INF/context.xml

i.e whatever  is the URL file path to the file edited in step 6. ( note the single slashed file:/ as a url base)


( For some reason, the application doesn't work as a drop-in war file yet, perhaps something to do with the pooled 
database connections and tomcat mediating it ).

When the deploy button is pressed, there should be an OK - test-struts-2 deployed message, 

12. Using the demographics application:   go to http://localhost:8080/test-struts-3
click login.
the user name  "admin" , password "password"  is the only login.
From the login page, a new patient can be created or patient search is done. 
Clicking patient names found will edit that patient. 
Clicking clinical next to the patient name, will take to the first clinical screen, which is non-functional.
