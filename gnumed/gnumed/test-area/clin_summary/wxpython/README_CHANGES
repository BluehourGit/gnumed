gmGuiMain :
	added lines to get a NoteBook ui factory, which gives a map by names of 
	the ui to install into each page of the notebook. Currently ,
	has an entry for " selectPersonDialogFactory" , which gives an object
	that can create a selectPersonDialog, which has it's new button configured
	and it's combobox hooked to a sql string generator which feedsback on
	the gmSQlListControl.

	
GmSelectPerson :
	this has a "Commands" interface, so that the buttons can be configured with
	a Map; ComboBox text events are also fed into a Command.  

	Command pattern is used ( why? not sure), i.e. function objects. Just for code partitioning.

Simple...  almost all prototype classes are call Simple...

	configuration,  factory and command classes.
	
	SimpleNewPersonCommand and SimpleNewPersonStoreCommand implement the new Person use case.
	SimpleNewPerson brings up a patient entry form, then passes the result to SimpleNewPersonStore
	which normalizes the data (I didn't see the triggers on my version of gm_identity).

							There is also a SimpleRecordPanel which
	takes a list of ( name, size, ..[other params in future] ) typles , and generates 
	a UI. Since it's used just in a dialog, there is no Command interface yet. When the Dialog finishes
	a map of name->value entries are returned.  


There is also a sql script to add a new person view, as I didn't find one initially.

To implement editPerson:

	changed gmSQLListCtrl  to cache the query result, and added GetRow(index) in order to 
	determine what was selected in the list


SimpleEditPersonCommand and SimpleEditPersonStoreCommand collaborate with SimpleViewPerson2Map to 
get mappings from ui field names to database field names. gmSimpleSQLSearch was left the same,
so it uses database field names as column names.

SimpleEditPersonStoreCommand uses the identities.id and address.id to update, and the
view_person2 sql view must have an id field which is the identities.id to work properly.

double click on a patient, and the summary sheet will come up.
phx and meds are linked to views ( all the rest still need to be done)
Modify SimpleSummaryMap to put in the views commands.

person_view2 changed, the id was moved

summary sheet developing, 2-tier sql commands in Command classes, using maps ; correct field/ table names important
RIGHT CLICK shows up NEW EDIT DELETE , currently doing NewStore for PHX ,
( the storage commands will all be different )


problems with contained FlexGridSizer, so went back to horizontal within vertical box sizers. 
Why doesn't wxPython have a proper Containment hierarchy ?


30/3/2002
floating display of all data in one part
now has paragraph display of excessively long fields
should be able to handle multiple excessively long fields in one row

personView2Map decoupled from SimpleNewPersonCommand

SimpleEnterNotesCommand can be configured for a Notebook.
Assign responsibility for SummaryUIWindow allocation elsewhere?
