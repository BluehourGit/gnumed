search with each letter stroke after first 1, in search box.
selecting and double-clicking or enter on the name, changes to summary panel
new and edit on person search panel buttons work. brings up simple entry dialog.
NB mainstream person dialog respects gis integrity, and enforces integrity constraint on 
localities (concept relation- (city, state, postcode, country) must exist in gis) 
this person update  doesn't yet. 

summary panel allows updating of past history and allergies , currently
popup formatted full display of summary part e.g. for long histories, when mouse hovers
above part for more then 0.5 seconds.
popup disappears when moves out. A bit mouse dependent.

Differences in sql:

uses a revocation table which stores the  auditing id of revoked rows in all tables sharing
a root auditing table. 

advantages
 - easier to program 
This lets updating by insert statements for both  new, edit and delete
cases, and the same insert statement is used. Edit and delete just means the previous record's
audit id is added to the revocation table.

Disadvantages :
-  can lead to a lot of obsolete records in the tables. This happens with
the names table in the mainstream development. Possible solution might be to automate a
periodic cull of old records into archive tables by selecting on those records whose audit id are
 present in the revocation table.  
     - makes the database vulnerable to attack on one table. Instead of trying to mess
up each table which has a active field,  could just delete one table , the revocation table,
and knowledge of which records are obsolete are lost.

- the primary key no longer is the id field of a table, but the audit_id and the id of the table.
This piece of wierdness probably has a lot of implications that makes this scheme undesirable.
