1. extra properties on sub-command <hibernate> of hibernatdoclet task. Set the version to 2.0 to generate
    hibernate 2.0 mappings, 
2. the hibernate-mappings-dtd-2.0.xml file inside the hibernat2.jar may be missing
    a <!ATTLIST definition for dynamic-insert in the "class" attributes .
    Also for subclass and joined-subclass as well. Need to add this for xdoclet generated
    hibernate config  files to work.
    

3. mapping for polymorphic persistence error a pain. Remove id from subclasses , try deleting
all generated hbm.xml files, if can't find from reading the files. Fixed with persistence.

4. comment out cross-package reference from gmIdentity to gmClinical and debug that.
   
5. misspelled generator-clas  so Names didn't have generator class at runtime.

6. stage 1 test is to test persistence of gmIdentity.

7. got postcode.csv.au objects construction to work.
    problems with method call ( calling parseTokens twice in one loop accidently).
    forgot ACT so had null state in ACT suburbs.
    tried caching the whole lot of objects, but didn't improve spped.
    tried caching 10 objects at a time with count and cycle variables, seems to work a little.
    main determinant of time spent inserting seems to be size of table. Maybe the table is hash bucket
    with collisions. Need to have option of use btree in hibernate. 
    Best time is I can get is 90-100 secs for 8900 objects.

8. to get proper dropping in SchemaExport, had to edit the hibernate source at net.sf.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect to return the " cascade"; string in blah-blah getCascade() and rebuild.

9. test cases helped define where cascade "save-update" is needed in hibernate tags e.g. in identity and in identities_addresses 

10. trying to access sessions via HibernateInit which keeps tracks of created sessions, and only
keeps one session active . This avoids conflicting sessions within the same thread.
