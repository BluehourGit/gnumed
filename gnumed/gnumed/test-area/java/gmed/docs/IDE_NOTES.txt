I used netbeans because it is open source, and I'm familiar with it.

Other pluses:
    - it's gui construction editor takes advantages of the object -oriented organization of
    swing components. It does have a few quirks - like not being able to insert a component
    easily in a list of components.
    pluses - can create a gui component and drop it into any container gui.

   
Configuration:
    the ./java directory needs to be mounted in order to edit the code . The mount point is the
    root package, so in order for the ide to check against other classes, anything used should be mounted
    e.g. select mount archive, and go into the ./lib directory, and then multi-select all the jar files
    and mount them.

    the custom_hbm directory files need to be edited when hand coding many-to-many associations , but this is already 
    mounted when the project directory is mounted.
