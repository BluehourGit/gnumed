<!--- the above defines the set's name , which is it's role. The role is the other end of the bidirectional association,
	; the table is standard many-to-many association ER-to-relational mapping , a  link table with foreign keys to the
	2 tables involved in the association.
	
	; one end must be readonly ? to avoid a cycle when saving.
	; lazy means a proxy is used ? for each object in the set, which only has the id.
	
	
	The key column describes the name of the foreign key column in the link table pointing to  the current class's
	table primary key. 
	
	The many-to-many description needs the class of the other end of the association, and the column name which
	is the foreign key in the link table to that other class's table primary key.
