To build and run the test code , you need

	1. jdk1.4
	2. lib files from hibernate1.2 lib directory
	3. some configuration files from hibernate 1.2 e.g. hibernate.properties
	4. ant build tool
	5. some xdoclet build libraries.
	6. the backend jdbc driver jar eg. pgsqlxxx.jar
	7. junit.jar for testing

Development seems to be easiest using 
	1. an argouml based uml tool
	2. netbeans ide  (autofilling really helps).
		- 3.5 also has adequate ant tool which can
		run from browsing the build.xml directory
		- when mounting the project 
		mount the base directory to reach the build.xml file
		mount the java directory to correcting parse the
		package tree.
		mount the jars in the lib directory so that 
		netbeans correctly checks the code that uses 
		the additional libraries such as hibernate correctly.

Most used documentation
	jdk docs.
	hibernate reference docs, and api docs for Hibernate, Session,
	and the example code in the hibernate distribution ( for 
	hibernate setup code).
	
	xdoclet hibernate tags documentation.
	cross-reference with hibernate reference document to understand
	hbm.xml syntax.
