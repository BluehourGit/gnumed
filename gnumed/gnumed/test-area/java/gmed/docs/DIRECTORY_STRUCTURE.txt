./java contains the files which are ready to be compiled, and
require HAND CODING. Most code is altered here.
	e.g. xdoclet tagged domain files.
 	     test files to test hibernate configuration for these domain files.

	     The goal is to make hibernate work as the persistent store system
	     for those domain files.

./custom_hbm contain files that are merged with xdoclet generated hbm.xml files.
They must be named hibernate-properties-XXXX.xml where XXXX is the entity name.
The top level of the xml document is the property level of the target hbm.xml file.

	The goal of these files is to provide for more complex relationships, without
	resorting to "link" classes whose only role is to store associations.
	e.g. many-to-many relationships can be mapped by the idiom in TEMPLATE_MANY_TO_MANY.txt.
	and hibernate will automatically use the  Set properties that represent the association
	in the classes, and map them to and from the link tables.


./generated
One goal is to use a good uml tool such as Poseidon which generates the association
code, and use them as the basis of the domain files in ./java 
This allows easier modelling of the associations.
The Poseidon generated files are stored here.

./lib 
	the libraries used; usually the libraries from xdoclet and hibernate and any 
	jdbc jars for whatever database is being used.

./build
        this directory contains a build.
        
./build/class
        the class files and the merged hibernate configuration files.
