./java contains the source java stuff.
./generated_hbm contains a copy of the usable hbm.xml files within
the build/class directory tree.
./backup_generated_hbm  is a backup of the usable files. They have
a habit of being deleted.



./build/class is where the executable files are held, including
the configuration files. hbm.xml files are within the same directory
as the class files.

./build/script is the sql DDL code generated by hibernate's SchemaExport.

./lib contain the needed libraries.

./uml contains the design diagrams 
,/uml/graphics are snapshots of the current diagrams.
Poseidon community edition was used to construct and edit these diagrams.

./generated is the skeleton java files generated by poseidon.

./script contains some utility scripts for copying recentlty edited and
working hbm.xml files from the build/class directory tree into the
generated_hbm directory, and for copying back lost working hbm files,
when the hbm files are imperfectly regenerated using the xdoclet ant subtask.


The source files are organized as

xgmed
	domain				-	the domain classes.
		common
		observation
		planning
			outcome
			resource
		accountability

	test	
					-	the unit testing code.


The domain model is based on Fowlers' analysis patterns.


./docs are the documentation

this and DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.txt describe the project file layout.

CONSTRUCTION_NOTES.txt and BUILD_TACTIC.txt describes the incremental build (idiosyncratic) behaviour.

DEPENDENCIES.txt - describe what components libraries and tools are needed.

IDE_NOTES.txt describe how to mount on netbeans for assisted development.

DEBUG.txt describes encountered bugs during testing
