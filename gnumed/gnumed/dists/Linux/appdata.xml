        <p>
            GNUmeds purpose is to enable doctors to keep a medically
            sound record on their patients' health. It does not currently
            provide functionality for stock keeping. Clinical features
            are well-tested by real doctors in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the GNUmed team has taken the utmost care to make sure
            the medical records are safe at all times you still need to
            make sure you are taking appropriate steps to backup the
            medical data to a safe place at appropriate intervals. Do
            not forget to test your recovery procedures, too !
        </p>

            Protect your data! GNUmed itself comes without
            any warranty whatsoever. You have been warned.
