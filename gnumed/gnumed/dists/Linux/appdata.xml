 <summary>An Electronic Medical Record for community care</summary>
 <description>
	<p>
	GNUmed enables doctors to keep a medically sound record
	on their patients' health. It does not currently provide
	functionality for stock keeping. Clinical features are
	well-tested by real doctors in the field.
	</p>
	<p>
	While the GNUmed team has taken the utmost care to make
	sure the medical records are safe at all times you still
	need to make sure you are taking appropriate steps to
	backup medical data to a safe place at appropriate intervals.
	Do not forget to test your recovery procedures, too !
	</p>
	<p>
	Protect your data! GNUmed itself comes without
	any warranty whatsoever. You have been warned.
