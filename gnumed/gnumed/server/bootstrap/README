--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The files and scripts in this directory are intended for
bootstrapping a new or upgrading an existing GNUmed database.

The main bootstrapper is bootstrap_gm_db_system.py. It does
all the heavy lifting including setting up the database,
making sure users and procedural languages are set up and
importing the schema definition files.

The redo-v2 shell script sets up a new GNUmed v2 database. Any
existing gnumed_v2 database WILL BE DROPPED.

The upgrade-db.sh script upgrades an existing GNUmed database.
The original database WILL NOT BE CHANGED in any way.

Bootstrapping is a rather complicated affair. Here are some
prerequisites that need to be matched:

1) You need to be able to connect to template1 and the
   target database (gnumed_v*) as "gm-dbo" and "postgres".

2) You need to have the procedural language pl/pgsql
   available.

Enjoy and please do report bugs !
