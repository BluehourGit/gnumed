--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The files and scripts in the bootstrap/ directory are intended for
bootstrapping a new or upgrading an existing GNUmed database.

The main bootstrapper is bootstrap_gm_db_system.py. It does
all the heavy lifting including setting up the database,
making sure users and procedural languages are set up and
importing the schema definition files.

The bootstrap-latest.sh shell script creates the latest version
of the GNUmed database from scratch. It DROPS any EXISTING
gnumed_v* DATABASES along the way.

The upgrade-db.sh script upgrades an existing GNUmed database.
The original database WILL NOT BE CHANGED in any way. This allows
for SAFE UPGRADES from one database version to the next.

Bootstrapping is a rather complicated affair. Here are some
prerequisites that need to be matched:

1) The scripts are best run as root.

2) You need to have the procedural language
   pl/pgsql available.

3) After bootstrapping you need to add the following
   lines to your pg_hba.conf file to allow GNUmed
   users to connect:

# for local connections from the same machine
local	samegroup	+gm-logins							md5

# for remote connections from other machines
host	samegroup	+gm-logins		<IP/NETMASK>		md5



Enjoy and please do report bugs !
