These files form a PHP interface to the gnumed drug database.

First, create a gmdrugs database on PostgreSQL (../sql/gmdrugs.sql), make sure you have 
access to this database. Open connect.php in this directory an change the username foo to your username.

Then, copy them to a directory available to the webserver.

PHP >= 4.1, must be running on the webserver,

Then point your browser to 
listclasses.php, and enjoy!
