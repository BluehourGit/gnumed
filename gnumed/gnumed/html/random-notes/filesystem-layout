CVS areas:

"production quality" area = main development
--------------------------------------------
 - sort of mirrors deployment directories
 - put in place during some sort of install procedure of a
   gnumed.rpm|deb|tgz.
 - For other operating systems I don't have such a clear vision,
   unfortunately. One should probably hang everything off of one
   directory such as <drive>:\gnumed\ or some such (which
   directory can easily be detected automatically at runtime so
   that the user can choose freely).

CVS:main://doc -> /usr/share/gnumed/doc/
 - link there from /usr/share/doc/packages/gnumed/ or whatever is LSB

CVS:main://lib/python/ -> /usr/share/gnumed/lib/python/
 - client-independant, general python modules
 - python programs then do 'system.path.append("/usr/share/gnumed/lib/python/")'

CVS:main://default-client/ -> /usr/share/gnumed/default-client/
 - one such directory for each client
 - default-client/lang/ = po files
 - default-client/gui/ = GUI plugins (see test_area/terry/
 - client specific modules live here, too
 - symlink /usr/bin/gnumed to /usr/bin/share/gnumed/<my-preferred-client>/client-binary

CVS:main://server/ -> server stuff only
 - server/sql/ = about the same as now
 - server/tools/ = housekeeping scripts, etc.
