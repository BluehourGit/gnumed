Consulting our "inofficial packaging manager" (Andreas Tille)
revealed that "binaries" should live under /usr/share/gnumed/

There I suggest ./images/ ./python-modules/ and various ./*client*/
subdirectories - one for each client. General (non
client-specific python modules (such as gmLog) should live in
./python-modules/ whereas client specific ones should live
side by side with the client itself (or a subdirectory thereof
as is the case now with ./gui/ in ./test-area/terry/

There should be a symlink from /usr/bin/gnumed to
/usr/share/gnumed/my-preferred-client/gnumed-n.mm.py

For other operating systems I don't have such a clear vision,
unfortunately. One should probably hang everything off of one
directory such as <drive>:\gnumed\ or some such (which
directory can easily be detected automatically at runtime so
that the user can choose freely).

This structure should be "mirrored" in CVS and put in place
during some sort of install procedure of a gnumed.rpm|deb|tgz.

Developers can just symlink into the appropriate dirs of their
local CVS copy.

Comments ?

Horst ?
