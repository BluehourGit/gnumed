'''

The *GNUmed* project builds a free, _liberated_ open source
*Electronic Medical Record* software in _multiple languages_ to assist
and improve longitudinal care (specifically in ambulatory settings, i.e.
multi-professional practices and clinics).

It is made available at no charge and is capable of running on
GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. It is developed by a handful of medical
doctors and programmers from all over the world.

It can be *useful to* anyone documenting the health of patients
including, but not limited to, *doctors, physical therapists,
occupational therapists, acupuncturists, nurses, psychologists* ...
