locale/
-------
All the message catalogs live here.

On a POSIX system files from here should be moved into
/usr/share/locale/... or the corresponding standard place.

On Windows they must live right here relative to ../wxpython/
so that gmI18N can find them regardless.

create_po_file.sh
-----------------
This is a convenience UNIX shell script that takes all
Python source files below the directory given as the
first command line argument and aggregates
them into one "*.po" file named after the second argument.

The resulting *.po file needs to be filled in with
translations and copied to the appropriate language directory

 locale/<ISO_lang>/LC_MESSAGES/

where <ISO_lang> stands for ISO code of the country the
translation is intended for.

To create a *.po file for GNUmed run it like this:

 create_po_file.sh /my/path/to/gnumed/client/ gnumed
