locale/
-------
All the message catalogs live here.

On a POSIX system file from here should be moved into
/usr/share/locale/... or the corresponding standard place.

On Windows they must live right here relative to ../wxpython/
so that gmI18N can find them regardless.

create_po_file.sh
-----------------
This is a convenience UNIX shell script that takes all
Python source files below gnumed/client/ and aggregates
them into one "gnumed.po" file.
