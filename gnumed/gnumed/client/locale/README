locale/
-------
All the message catalogs live here.

On a POSIX system files from here should be moved into
/usr/share/locale/... or the corresponding standard place.

On Windows they must live right here relative to ../wxpython/
so that gmI18N can find them regardless.

create-gnumed_pot.sh
--------------------
You guessed it.

This is a convenience shell script for UNIX that takes all
Python source files and creates a current gnumed.pot file
containing all current strings for translation. It then merges
this new file with a repository files containing the already
translated strings or it creates such a repository file.

The resulting ${LANG}.po file needs to be filled in with
more translations, compiled into gnumed.mo and moved to the
appropriate language directory

 locale/<ISO_lang>/LC_MESSAGES/

where <ISO_lang> stands for the ISO code of the country the
translation is intended for.
