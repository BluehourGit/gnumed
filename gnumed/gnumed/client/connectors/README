This directory stores connectors specific to this client.

Connectors are intermediate programs that 3rd party legacy
applications can use to control a GNUmed instance.

The one provided connector can be used by any practice
management application in Germany that knows how to output
GDT or BDT files. The connector reads the patient from
the xDT file, attaches to GNUmed via XML-RPC, locks into
that patient and raises a particular plugin (gmShowMedDocs
in this case). If you want your xdt connector to do
something different you can derive a class from the
cXdtConnector class and override the run_script() method.

The calls you can use on the controlled GNUmed instance are
the methods provided by client/wxpython/gmMacro.py.
