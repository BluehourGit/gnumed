This directory contains Python code as generated from *.wxg
XML files by wxGlade. The classes define what certain parts
of the GUI look like. They are inherited from by actual UI
classes in client/wxpython/.

DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IN THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY !

It will be overwritten the next time someone changes the GUI
with wxGlade and puts the file in here. All your changes
will be lost. If you want to make your changes permanent
edit the appropriate *.wxg file in client/wxg/ (preferably
using wxGlade), regenerate the GUI code and put it here.
