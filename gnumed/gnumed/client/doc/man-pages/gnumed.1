.SH DESCRIPTION
.B GNUmed
is a solution for managing a medical practice. It primarily
focuses on GP offices. It is released under the GPL.

GNUmed is written in Python with wxPython/wxWindows. Data is stored
in PostgreSQL databases possibly distributed onto several machines.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.B \--quiet
Be extra quiet and show only _real_ errors in the log.
.TP
.B \--debug
Be extra verbose and report nearly everything that's going on. Useful for, well, debugging :-)
.TP
.B \--talkback
Run the client and upon exiting run a talkback client where
you can enter a comment and send the log off to the bug hunters.
Very useful when used in conjunction with --debug.
.TP
.B \--text-domain=TEXTDOMAIN
Set this to change the name of the language file to be loaded.
Note, this does not change the directory the file is searched in,
only the name of the file where messages are loaded from. The
standard textdomain is, of course, "gnumed.mo". You need only
specify the base name of the file without the .mo extension.
.TP
.B \--log-file=FILE
Use this to change the name of the log file. The default
log file would be <~/.gnumed/gnumed.log>.
.TP
.B \--conf-file=FILE
Use configuration file FILE instead of searching for it in
standard locations.
.TP
.B
--unicode-gettext=0|1
Use unicode (1) or non-unicode (0) gettext. This is needed for older
(< 2.5) and non-unicode compiled wxWidgets/wxPython libraries. The
default is 1, eg. do use unicode.
.TP
.B \--help, -h, or -?
Well, show this help.


.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B GNUMED_DIR
If GNUMED_DIR is set it will be included in the list of pathes
to be searched for for various components of GNUmed.
.TP
.B LANG, LC_MESSAGES, etc.
See gettext(1) for how the various locale related environment
variables work.
