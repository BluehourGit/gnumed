The plugin configuration is now implemented as follows:

Upon startup GnuMed tries to read a list of which plugins to
load. It looks in several places:

1) in the database (the config tables in gmconfiguration.sql
   need to be imported)
   a) as the current user on the current machine
   b) as the current user on the "default" machine
   c) as the "default" user on the current machine
   d) as the "default" user on the "default" machine
2) in the file plugins.conf in the corresponding plugin
   directory (note that the format changed - this is now
   expected to be a standard gmCfg config file, group is
   "plugins", the list option "load order")
3) direct scan of the plugin directory

If any of the stages one b-d finds corresponding data that
configuration is saved specific to the current user/machine.

If stage two finds a plugins.conf file it assumes that the
admin has set up a default for all users of this machine and
thus writes that configuration into the database specific to
the current user/machine.

Stage three will always load all available plugins. It will
therefore write that configuration into the database specific
to the machine but not specific to a user (eg. to the default
user).

Subsequent loading will thus find the configuration at earlier
stages. Thusly the client should be autoconfiguring to a
certain degree.

I have not yet connected to the backend explicit add/drop of
plugins via Ian's new popup menu. This will come next.
