> 1.) newer versions of wxPython for GTK  now come packaged including wxGTK =
> only one library to download and install. Minimum version should be now 2.3.2
>
> 2.) re Mandrake install and dependency on old libpng:  works nice with the
> new one, just create a symbolic link from the new version to the old one.
>
> 3.) as there were no further comments re database adapter, we go for PyPgSQL
> for the following reasons:

> - Windows binary available as "setup.exe"
> - Clean install on all Linux versions via setup.py
> - native support of listen/notify without need for further libraries

> 4.) Python minimum version is now 2.2. Has been stable for quite a while, no
> point in sticking to older versions as I will use a few of the really nice
> new features for the database libraries
