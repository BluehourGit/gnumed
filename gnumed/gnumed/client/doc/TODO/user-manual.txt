Belongs into Admin->Config:

Upon startup the client autoconfigures the language used
in the database.

The following things influence its decision:

The language is taken from the system locale in the environment
variables checked for the GUI language by gmI18N.py.

If there's no i18n_curr_lang table in the database the client
assumes that no translations are wanted and tries to work
without it. Same if other errors prevent normal operations - a
warning is logged and things continue.

If the language given in the database doesn't match the system
locale the user is asked whether to update the database setting
to that. One can influence the system locale setting in
per-instance wrapper scripts if so desired.

The database language setting is only updated if translations
are actually available for the target language. Two levels of
truncation of the system locale are used to find matching
translations:

1) full locale: 'de_DE@euro'
2) no dialect:  'de_DE'
3) no country:  'de'

This allows for a missing Austrian translation to fall back to
a general German (de_AT -> de) one, for example.
---------------------------------------------------
I looked up the syntax in gmCfg.py, but could I suggest that a line be 
inserted in the bootstrap_gm-db.py file which says something like

#before running this script:
#
#-make sure you've installed the symbolic links as listed in make-links.sh
# you can run this by typing sh make-links.sh
#
#-make sure you check the section: 
#language library dirs = $language library dirs$
#to make sure the pathways point to the pgsql libraries
#
#usage :
# python bootstrap_gm-db.py --conf-file=yourconfigfilenamehere
# e.g bootstrap_gm-db.py --conf-file=bootstrap-standard_AU.conf
#

Anyway, I can now get up the interface at work, so perhaps having struggled 
twice to do this the third time (when I get my dead machine at home back) 
it'll be relatively easy. when I do I'll keep a line by line instruction set 
to add to the installation docs.

Regards

Richard

GnuMed Install Instructions for Mandrake Linux 9.1
by Michael Bonert

1. Install CVS (from the Mandrake CDs):
	cvs-1.11.5-1mdk

2. Install postgresql (from the Mandrake CDs):
	postgresql-7.3.2-5mdk
	postgresql-devel-7.3.2-5mdk
	postgresql-python-7.3.2-5mdk
	postgresql-server-7.3.2-5mdk
	postgresql-pl-7.3.2-5mdk

	pgaccess-0.98.8.20030117-2mdk		# nice to have
	postgresql-docs-7.3.2-5mdk		# nice to have

	NOTE: If the packages all show up when you do a
	'remove software packages' (in 'mcc') they are all
	installed.

3. Install wxPython -- (version used: wxPythonGTK-py2.2-2.4.0.7-1.i386.rpm)
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPythonGTK-py2.2-2.4.0.7-1.i386.rpm

	NOTE: You should already have installed python from the Mandrake CDs.
		python-2.2.2-6mdk
		python-base-2.2.2-6mdk
		python-docs-2.2.2-6mdk		# nice to have

4. Install mx extenstion libraries -- (egenix-mx-base-2.0.4-py2.2_1.i386.rpm)
	http://www.egenix.com/files/python/egenix-mx-base-2.0.4-py2.2_1.i386.rpm

5. Install pyPgSQL (pyPgSQL-2.3.tar.gz)
	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=16528

Before building and installing pyPgSQL make sure you have the following
(from the Mandrake CDs):
	libpython2.2-devel-2.2.2-6mdk

$ tar zxvf pyPgSQL-2.3.tar.gz 		# gunzip + untar 'pyPgSQL-2.3.tar.gz'
$ cd pypgsql

Set include and library directories in "setup.py" with your favourite editor:
---
    # Set this to 1 if you need to use your own settings
    	USE_CUSTOM = 1				# Don't forget to change this line!!!

    ...

    if USE_CUSTOM:
    	include_dirs = ["/usr/include/pgsql"]
        library_dirs = ["/usr/lib/pgsql"]
---
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install

NOTE: If the directory settings in 'setup.py' are wrong you get a misleading error about 'gcc'

Testing pyPgSQL:
$ cd test			# install directory: ../pypgsql/test
$ python PgSQLTestCases.py

OUTPUT:
	..................................................................
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Ran 66 tests in 1.090s

	OK


6. Get GnuMed source
RECOMMENDATION: install gnumed in "/home/your_user_name/"
	-- where 'your_user_name' is your favourite normal user - e.g. 'michael'

$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnumed login
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnumed checkout gnumed

7. set 'GNUMED_DIR' variable
$ cd 			# cd to home
$ vi .bash_profile	# or your favourite text editor

Add the following:
---
GNUMED_DIR=$GNUMED_DIR/home/your_user_name/gnumed/gnumed/client
---

	ASIDE:
		At this stage you can test the GUI with a public database.
		Email Karsten (Karsten.Hilbert@gmx.net) or Michael
		(michael.bonert@utoronto.ca) for the user name and
		password.

		Then...
		$ cd /home/your_user_name/gnumed/gnumed/client/wxpython
		$ python gnumed.py --debug
			A "Welcome to the" [GnuMed] window should appear.

		Click the "Options" button of the "Welcome to the" [GnuMed project] window
			An "Advanced login options" window should appear.

		Enter the following in it:
			gnumed-public  		(for 'database')
			anubis.homeunix.com 	(for 'host')
			5432			(for 'port' this should be the default)
		Click "Ok" to accept.

		In the "Welcome to the" [GnuMed project] window:
			enter the user name sent to you in "user"
			enter the password sent to you in "password"

8. Modify postgresql.conf
$ su
# cd /var/lib/pgsql/data
# vi postgresql.conf
	change '#tcpip_socket=false' to 'tcpip_socket=on'

9. Modify "pg_hba.conf" found in "/var/lib/pgsql/data"
# vi pg_hba.conf

last part of our "pg_hba.conf" should look like this:
---
# Using sockets credentials for improved security. Not available everywhere,
# but works on Linux, *BSD (and probably some others)

#local  all     all     ident   sameuser
local   all         all                                             trust
host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust
---

10. Creating the database
(see -- http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnumed-devel/2003-02/msg00079.html)
$ su root
# passwd postgres		# change password (I don't know what the default is--
				# you'll need this password later so remember it.)
# su postgres
$ createuser your_user_name	# in my case: "createuser michael"	(answer 'y' to both questions)
$ createuser _your_user_name	# in my case: "createuser _michael"	(answer 'y' to both questions)


(as normal user)
$ cd /home/your_user_name/gnumed/gnumed/server/bootstrap
$ cp bootstrap-standard-AU.conf.sample your_user_name-db.conf
$ ln -s /home/your_user_name/gnumed/gnumed/client/python-common modules
$ ln -s /home/your_user_name/gnumed/gnumed/server/sql/ sql

	At this point you may want to confirm that postgresql is running:
	$ mcc
	click on 'System'
	click on 'DrakXServices...'
	'postgresql' should say 'running'

$ python bootstrap-gm_db_system.py --conf-file=your_user_name-db.conf
When prompted:
- yes
- give password
- give another password


NOTE 1: If you have problems the log file is in: "/home/your_user_name/.bootstrap-gm_db_system"
NOTE 2: Make sure you have a current version of the code from the CVS
NOTE 3: If bootstrapping fails it is a good idea to drop the gnumed database before trying again
		$ dropdb gnumed

	-----
	If you're still have problems bootstrapping:

	Capture the screen output from bootstrap:
	$ script -a bootstrapping.log		# opens a log file to capture output to display
	$ python bootstrap-gm_db_system.py --conf-file=your_user_name-db.conf
	$ exit					# closes 'script' session

	Send Karsten (Karsten.Hilbert@gmx.net) the follow files:
	- bootstrapping.log  		(in "/home/your_user_name/gnumed/gnumed/server/bootstrap")
	- bootstrap-gm_db_system.log	(in "/home/your_user_name/.bootstrap-gm_db_system")

-----
Running GnuMed with a local database:
$ cd /home/your_user_name/gnumed/gnumed/client/wxpython
$ python gnumed.py --debug
	A "Welcome to the" [GnuMed] window should appear.
		in "user" enter: 	your_user_name
		the password: 		(leave blank)

	If you haven't started gnumed with another database
	GnuMed will start with the following backend defaults:
		gnumed		(for 'database')
		127.0.0.1 	(for 'host')
		5432		(for 'port')

Find something you don't like and fix it... ;O)
