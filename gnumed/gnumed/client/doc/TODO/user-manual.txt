The plugin configuration is now implemented as follows:

IMHO this is GnuMed configuration information. Actually it
should live in an Administrators Guide as discussed recently
on the list but for now we can share admin and user staff
in the User Manual since we don't have much user level
information yet...

Upon startup GnuMed tries to read a list of which plugins to
load. It looks in several places:

1) in the database (the config tables in gmconfiguration.sql
   need to be imported)
   a) as the current user on the current machine
   b) as the current user on the "default" machine
   c) as the "default" user on the current machine
   d) as the "default" user on the "default" machine
2) in the file plugins.conf in the corresponding plugin
   directory (note that the format changed - this is now
   expected to be a standard gmCfg config file, group is
   "plugins", the list option "load order")
3) direct scan of the plugin directory

If any of the stages one b-d finds corresponding data that
configuration is saved specific to the current user/machine.

If stage two finds a plugins.conf file it assumes that the
admin has set up a default for all users of this machine and
thus writes that configuration into the database specific to
the current user/machine.

Stage three will always load all available plugins. It will
therefore write that configuration into the database specific
to the machine but not specific to a user (eg. to the default
user).

Subsequent loading will thus find the configuration at earlier
stages. Thusly the client should be autoconfiguring to a
certain degree.

I have not yet connected to the backend explicit add/drop of
plugins via Ian's new popup menu. This will come next.

pyPgSQL v2.3 is needed for db config string list support.

Note: 2.3beta does NOT work yet

GnuMed database user structure

PostgreSQL does not support read-write versus read-only connections.
To protect us from unwanted writes we emulate this separation by
setting up two accounts per user. The normal account name "user" is
used for read-only connections. This is ensured by only granting
SELECT rights to those accounts. The read-write account name is
formed by prepending a "_" to the normal account such that "user"
has a companian account named "_user". Those accounts are granted
appropriate INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE rights in the database.

As it is very tedious to grant rights to each and every single
account the concept of user groups is used. A group "group" is
actually granted SELECT rights only, while "_group" receives
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE rights on database objects. Users
are simply added to those groups, name "user" to group "group" and
"_user" to group "_group" thereby acquiring the respective database
rights.

Default groups that always exist in a properly configured GnuMed
database are:

gm-doctors			_gm-doctors
gm-staff_medical	_gm-staff_medical
gm-staff_office		_gm-staff_office
gm-trainees_medical
gm-trainees_office
gm-public

Notice how there are no write rights for trainees and the public.

gmPG will return read-only connections by default. If a read-write
connection is requested  by means of setting read_only = 0 a new
connection to the service is instantiated for the user "_CURRENT_USER".
Read-only connections are cached and shared, read-write ones are not.
