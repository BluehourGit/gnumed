language configuration:

If the user chooses "No" when asked whether the database locale
should be changed to match the system locale this decision will
be remembered in the config file (usually ~/.gnumed/gnumed.conf)
until either the system locale is changed or the option
removed from the config file. This option can also be edited
from within GnuMed courtesy of the ConfigRegistry plugin.
