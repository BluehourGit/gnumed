Belongs into Admin->Config:

Upon startup the client autoconfigures the language used
in the database.

The following things influence its decision:

The language is taken from the system locale in the environment
variables checked for the GUI language by gmI18N.py.

If there's no i18n_curr_lang table in the database the client
assumes that no translations are wanted and tries to work
without it. Same if other errors prevent normal operations - a
warning is logged and things continue.

If the language given in the database doesn't match the system
locale the user is asked whether to update the database setting
to that. One can influence the system locale setting in
per-instance wrapper scripts if so desired.

The database language setting is only updated if translations
are actually available for the target language. Two levels of
truncation of the system locale are used to find matching
translations:

1) full locale: 'de_DE@euro'
2) no dialect:  'de_DE'
3) no country:  'de'

This allows for a missing Austrian translation to fall back to
a general German (de_AT -> de) one, for example.
---------------------------------------------------
I looked up the syntax in gmCfg.py, but could I suggest that a line be 
inserted in the bootstrap_gm-db.py file which says something like

#before running this script:
#
#-make sure you've installed the symbolic links as listed in make-links.sh
# you can run this by typing sh make-links.sh
#
#-make sure you check the section: 
#language library dirs = $language library dirs$
#to make sure the pathways point to the pgsql libraries
#
#usage :
# python bootstrap_gm-db.py --conf-file=yourconfigfilenamehere
# e.g bootstrap_gm-db.py --conf-file=bootstrap-standard_AU.conf
#

Anyway, I can now get up the interface at work, so perhaps having struggled 
twice to do this the third time (when I get my dead machine at home back) 
it'll be relatively easy. when I do I'll keep a line by line instruction set 
to add to the installation docs.

Regards

Richard
