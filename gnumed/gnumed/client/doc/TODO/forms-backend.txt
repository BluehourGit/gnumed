Forms backend
-------------

A forms backend is required for prescription, as well as referrals.

Proposed XML definition:

<form>
<name>Example form</form>
<type>SCRIPT</type> -- currently "SCRIPT" or "REFERRAL"
<date>6/8/2003</date> -- date form comes into use
  <page>
    <field>
      <x>320</x><y>568</y> -- position from top left-hand, in 1/72 inch ("Postscript units"
      <width>400</width> -- maximum width of this field
      <font>SWISS</font> -- fonts, after the standard fonts defined in wxWindows
      <size>12</size> -- font size, in points
      <name>PATIENT_NAME</name> -- the actual field
    </field>
    -.... any number of field sections
  </page> -- multiple pages are allowed

<value> -- do not exist for "template" form files, hold data when saved in backend
  <field>PATIENT_NAME</field>
  <data>Ian Haywood</data>
</value>
</form>

Forms can define positions for a pre-defined list of fields, depending on their type (script or referral (request))

Common to both: PATIENT_NAME, PATIENT_NUMBER, PATIENT_ADDRESS, DOCTOR_NAME, DOCTOR_NUMBER

For scripts: DRUGS (forms engine must honour \n in a sensible way)

For referrals: INVESTIGATION, CLINICAL_NOTES

Future
------

Forms can define their own variables in a separate <new_field> section which gives clues 
to how fields are presented in the GUI (text box, spin control, pick list, &c)
True/false variables, on GUI as a tick box, can draw actual tick symbol on paper maybe

"Fixed_text" elements under "page" for fixed-text printed on every form (for Richard's "super-form")
