1) on-site module position locations

- Python modules in site-packages/Gnumed/
- docs in /usr/share/doc/gnumed/
- resources in /usr/lib/gnumed/
- user data in ~/gnumed/
- user config in ~/.gnumed/
- system config in /etc/gnumed/
- shell wrappers in /usr/bin/

CVS areas:

"production quality" area = main development
--------------------------------------------
 - sort of mirrors deployment directories
 - put in place during some sort of install procedure of a
   gnumed.rpm|deb|tgz.
 - For other operating systems I don't have such a clear vision,
   unfortunately. One should probably hang everything off of one
   directory such as <drive>:\gnumed\ or some such (which
   directory can easily be detected automatically at runtime so
   that the user can choose freely).

outdated but some good ideas:

CVS:main://default-client/ -> /usr/share/gnumed/default-client/
 - one such directory for each client
 - default-client/lang/ = po files
 - default-client/gui/ = GUI plugins (see test_area/terry/)
 - client specific modules live here, too
 - symlink /usr/bin/gnumed to /usr/bin/share/gnumed/<my-preferred-client>/client-binary

CVS:main://server/ -> server stuff only
 - server/sql/ = about the same as now
 - server/tools/ = housekeeping scripts, etc.
