$Revision: 1.1 $
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is the temporary roadmap. Please always include
an URL to this document when discussing items on the list.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

patient input/search/modification
 - no family relationship handling
 - search done (or nearly, in top panel)
 - mediocre attempt at input/modification available
 - input needs considerably more smarts


progress notes
 - simple SOAP structured text input fields
 - clin_note/clin_history/clin_physical rows
 - optional, partially done


export of progress notes
 - per patient
 - ASCII to text files for re-use
 - constrainable by date, encounter, episode, health issue
 - proof-of-intent for interoperability


third-party application connectivity
 - allow other apps to a GnuMed instance, lock it
   into a patient and release that lock later on
 - optional for Australia


drug information browser if data is available locally
 - PBS via drugref.org via XML-RPC, initially
 - AMIS (German) to follow


document archive
 - optional
 - nearly done


simple ConfigRegistry
 - complete default config data
 - nearly done


referrals handling
 - referral form (Germany)
 - accompanying referral letter


prescription
 - *very* complex to cover all cases (I can write a senior
   year AP English essay on that if you want)
 - start with simple, most common cases


past history/problem list
 - problem list only, really, since past history is either
   covered by 2) or not yet wanted (paper record)
 - problem list: some conceptual obfuscation as to how
   episodes overlap with diagnoses and problem lists
 - in a way, episode names *are* the problem list


path results
 - one excellently defined area of work
 - high on my list as well
 - easily assignable sub-project
