GnuMed temporary roadmap
========================
$Source: /home/ncq/Projekte/cvs2git/vcs-mirror/gnumed/gnumed/client/doc/TODO/Attic/temporary-roadmap.txt,v $
$Revision: 1.2 $
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is the temporary roadmap. Please always include
an URL to this document when discussing items on the list.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

patient input/search/modification
 - no family relationship handling
 - search done (or nearly, in top panel)
 - mediocre attempt at input/modification available
 - input needs considerably more smarts


progress notes
 - simple SOAP structured text input fields
 - clin_note/clin_history/clin_physical rows
 - optional, partially done
 

notes viewer
 - tree widget on the left side: health issues[1] and then episodes[2] in a hierarchy
 - drop down boxes across top for limiting by month/year etc.
 - display of clinical notes on the right
1: an ongoing health problem: COPD, niddm, etc.
2: a circumscribed clinical problem, may still span several consults: viz. infective exacerbation COPD

export of progress notes
 - per patient
 - ASCII to text files for re-use
 - constrainable by date, encounter, episode, health issue
 - proof-of-intent for interoperability


third-party application connectivity
 - allow other apps to a GnuMed instance, lock it
   into a patient and release that lock later on
 - optional for Australia


drug information browser if data is available locally
 - PBS via drugref.org via XML-RPC, initially
 - AMIS (German) to follow


document archive
 - optional
 - nearly done


simple ConfigRegistry
 - complete default config data
 - nearly done


referrals handling
 - referral form (Germany), uses common forms engine with prescription
 - accompanying referral letter


prescription
 - *very* complex to cover all cases (I can write a senior
   year AP English essay on that if you want)
 - start with simple, most common cases
As a starter 4 fields:
	- drug name, with auto-complete from database
	- strengths, drop-down from the list in the database
	- frequency. Recognises both "German"  and "Latin" notation. 
German: 4 integers for the 4 times during the day, separated by slashes, so 4 times a day is "1/1/1/1", one 
morning , 2 at night is "1/0/2/0"
Latin: m=mane, i=midi n=nocte, b=BD t=TDS, q=QID. So "2m" is 2 tabs mane, "1q" is 1 tab QID, "2m+2.5i" is 
2 mane and 2 & a half midi
	- directions. Free comment fields, auto-translation to vernacular for standard Latin abbreviations: 
PP, OU, AU, etc.
FUTURE: remembers previous values for a particular drug 
OPTIONAL: a "prescribing diagnosis" field which saves as an episode.
Prints outs using "forms engine" to specific page points. Scripts will be lawful in Australia: name, address, Medicare number, prescriber, etc. 

path results
 - one excellently defined area of work
 - high on my list as well
 - easily assignable sub-project
