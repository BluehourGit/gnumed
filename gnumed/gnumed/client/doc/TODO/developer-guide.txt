SQL hacking guidelines:

- don't use "\copy from stdin"
  reason: will kill server installation tools
- don't use "COPY from 'a file' unless importing really
  large datasets - and those should be imported entirely
  separate from the schema definition import
  reason: won't work non-local to the DB server
- always include gmSchemaRevision.sql in your schema
  definition files (see the file for instructions)
- normalize
- keep things generic
- split things into general and country-specific parts

database facts:

Each GnuMed database has a table "schema_revision". Doing a
 select * from schema_revision
will show you which version of which SQL file was imported
into this database (as long as they adhere to the GnuMed
SQL hacking guidelines).
