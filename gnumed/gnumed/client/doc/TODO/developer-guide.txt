-------------------------
Structural considerations
-------------------------
Health Issue
------------
A Health Issue is a longer ranging medical condition associated with
a patient. There may be several episodes related with one health
issue and there must be at least one. At times a health issue will
first be appreciated by considering underlying similarities between
several medically related episodes. A health issue may have a finite
duration if the underlying medical condition is eventually fully
resolved. It may also span the entire life of the patient such as
in chronic or genetic ailments. Start and end are not directly
recorded but must be derived from the start of the earliest and
the end of the most recent associated episode.

Clinical Episode
----------------
A Clinical Episode denotes a period of time during which the patient
was under care for one particular Health Issue (medical condition).
Several episodes (eg. progression, bouts, etc.) may be associated
with a particular health issue. There can be several encounters per
episode, there must be at least one. The start and end of an episode
isn't directly recorded but rather one can deduce that data from the
associated clinical items of which there will usually be several
(but at least one). Often, several providers will contribute to an
episode of care (via several encounters and items). One would think
that episodes can be deduced from clusters of closely related dates
of clinical encounters. While this is true it cannot be used reliably
in a programmatic way.

Clinical Encounter
------------------
A one-off contact between patient and health care system (or on behalf
of the patient) is called a "Clinical Encounter". An encounter is often
restricted to a given date but may span midnight and will thus refer to
two dates. The date itself is not directly stored in the encounter
table clin_encounter but must be determined from the commit timestamps
of the clinical items belonging to it. The encounter table records the
location, provider and subject of care as well as the type of encounter.
It really is more of an administrative than a purely clinical concept.
Note that it also does not fit hospital stays particularly well where
it is harder to define clean boundaries between encounters. One
encounter will often relate to more than one episode/health issue.

Clinical Item
-------------
In GnuMed a medically meaningful piece of information is called "Clinical
Item". Such items are typically elements of the SOAP structure such as a
diagnosis, a history item, an assessment, a plan, etc. Several tables,
both specific and generic store such items. They all inherit from the
table clin_root_item which records the Clinical Encounter and Clinical
Episode this item belongs to. Virtue of inheriting from clin_root_item all
Clinical Item tables also have a generic "narrative" field for comments
and clinical narrative.

Partial Contact
---------------
This concept of the Dutch Episode Model is not directly
represented in the GnuMed clinical table structure. It is
easily derived from the existing data by aggregating all
Clinical Items that belong to the same Clinical Encounter
and the same Clinical Episode.

-----------------------------
Implementation considerations
-----------------------------
Clinical narrative
------------------
Due to the fact that clinical items are stored in several different
specific and non-specific tables it is difficult to do a full-text
search across the medical record of a patient. For this reason all
clinical narrative is aggregated in the clin_root_item table. All
tables providing clinical narrative are supposed to inherit from
this table. If more than one field for free text is needed in a
table links to entries in clin_note must be used additionally
to the inherited clin_root_item.narrative field.

The view v_patient_items provides an aggregation of clinical
items per patient. From this one can derive the item ID and source
table of individual items. It also provides the full text of the
clinical narrative for all tables that inherit from clinical item.
Only very few clinically relevant narrative strings are not stored
in such tables, namely comments on clin_episode, clin_encounter
and clin_health_issue rows.

View v_patient_episodes
-----------------------
This view links episodes to patients.

View v_i18n_patient_encounters
------------------------------
This view links encounters to patients and provides a translated
encounter type (if a translation is available).

Predefined data
---------------
Wherever fixed strings are predefined for certain fields (such
as descriptions of encounter types or history item types) provisions
for translation of those strings via gmI18N.sql must be made. An
ID range for user-supplied additional strings must be defined. The
default language is English, other languages are handled via
translations. In appropriate cases views may facilitate easier
access to translated strings. Names of such views are to be
prepended by "v_i18n_".

Clinical items
--------------
All tables holding clinical items must inherit from clin_root_item.

=========================================
medically:

health issue

-> several episodes
   -> several encounters
      -> several partial contacts
         -> several items
