Installation instructions
-------------------------

If you checked out GnuMed from CVS or downloaded the tarball
there is nothing to install, really. Everything can be run
right from the directory where you put the files.

You need to make sure, however, that you have all the necessary
3rd party components installed. For this use:

	gnumed/check-prerequisites.sh

You can bootstrap a database with help of the shell scripts in

	gnumed/server/bootstrap/

You can run the client with help of the shell scripts in

	gnumed/client/

If questions arise ask on the mailing list.


Enjoy !
